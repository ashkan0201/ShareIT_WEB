In this project, a web will be created in which the file can be uploaded.
That means you can upload the file you want on the web.
Then you can completely delete the saved files or even download any file you want.

In this project, `sqlite` is used to store data.
There is a folder named `files` in which files are saved when the program is running.
The `template` folder contains the html file that is for the front end of the project.

Its use is when you are a router and devices are connected to you.
They can access the files when they enter your web address on their system.
It is used for communication between files.
